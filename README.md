# Sequence-Models
Programming assignments of "Sequence Models"(https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models/) course of deep learning specialization by Andrew Ng in Coursera.

# Project 1 - Building-a-Recurrent-Neural-Network-Step-by-Step
In this project I've built a RNN and LSTM from scratch.

# Project 2 - Building a RNN which generates Dinosaur names.
I've used a RNN on a dinosaur names dataset in order to predict the next character.
The RNN successfully generated dinosaur names.
I learned: 
- How to store text data for processing using an RNN
- How to synthesize data, by sampling predictions at each time step and passing it to the next RNN-cell unit
- How to build a character-level text generation recurrent neural network
- Why clipping the gradients is important
